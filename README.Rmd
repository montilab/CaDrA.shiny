An R Shiny Dashboard for Interacting with **[CaDrA](https://montilab.github.io/CaDrA/)** Package 

### **Documentation: [https://montilab.github.io/CaDrA/](https://montilab.github.io/CaDrA/)**

### **Web Portal: [https://cadra.bu.edu/](https://cadra.bu.edu/)**

## Overview

**CaDrA-shiny** is an interactive R Shiny dashboard that was developed to allow users to directly interacting with **CaDrA** package. **CaDrA** is an R package that supports a heuristic search framework aimed at identifying candidate drivers of a molecular phenotype of interest (visit [our Github repo](https://github.com/montilab/CaDrA) for more details). 

The CaDrA's shiny dashboard has two distinctive features:

1. Run **CaDrA** search to identify candidate drivers of a molecular phenotype of interest
2. Run **GSVA** to obtain relative enrichment scores for a given gene sets, then subsequently, these scores are used to run **CaDrA** search to look for complementary features that likely driving the input of molecular phenotype. 

Data visualization includes:

- Meta-feature plot 
- Kolmogorov Smirnov (KS) enrichment plot
- Top N candidates overlapping heatmap
- Permutation-based testing plot 

The **CaDrA.shiny** package is already containerized using **Docker** and can be deployed on any Cloud-based services.

#### **Docker image: [montilab/cadra-shiny](https://hub.docker.com/r/montilab/cadra-shiny)**

# Run CaDrA Shiny App on RStudio Desktop

Don't have RStudio Desktop installed, download [here](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/).

### (1) Installation

```r
library(devtools)
devtools::install_github("montilab/CaDrA.shiny")
```

### (2) Load packages

```r
library(CaDrA.shiny)
```

### (3) Launch CaDrA's Shiny App with dataset included in the package

```r
CaDrA.shiny::CaDrA_App(id="myapp")
```

### (4) Launch CaDrA's Shiny App with your pre-proccessed dataset

**Required:** 
a data file (in **csv** or **rds** format) that includes paths to your pre-proccessed dataset with the following column fields populated:

- feature_set_names
- feature_set_paths
- input_score_names
- input_score_paths
- gene_expression_names
- gene_expression_paths

Here is an example of **mydatafile.csv**:
![](man/figures/datalist.png)

To launch the app:
```r
# Read in the data file that includes paths to your pre-proccessed dataset
mydatafile <- read.csv('/path/to/mydatafile.csv', header=TRUE)

# Launch CaDrA's Shiny app with your loaded data file
CaDrA.shiny::CaDrA_App(id="myapp", datalist_file=mydatafile)
```

### (6) Launch CaDrA's Shiny App with dataset download from our API portal

#### (i) Retrieve pre-processed dataset from API

```r
# Read in the data file that includes paths to your pre-proccessed dataset
mydatafile <- read.csv('/path/to/mydatafile.csv', header=TRUE)

# Launch CaDrA's Shiny app with your loaded data file
CaDrA.shiny::CaDrA_App(id="myapp", datalist_file=mydatafile)
```

#### (ii) Launch CaDrA's app with downloaded dataset

```r
# Read in the data file that includes paths to your pre-proccessed dataset
mydatafile <- read.csv('/path/to/mydatafile.csv', header=TRUE)

# Launch CaDrA's Shiny app with your loaded data file
CaDrA.shiny::CaDrA_App(id="myapp", datalist_file=mydatafile)
```
