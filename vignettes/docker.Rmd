## Software requirements

- Docker version >= 20.10
- Git version >= 2.21

Don't have Docker installed, see [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

Don't have Git installed, see [Git Guides](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git)

## Container dependencies

- montiab/cadra:2.0.0 (stored on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/montilab/cadra))

## Build Docker image

### (1) Clone this respitory

```bash
git clone https://github.com/montilab/CaDrA.shiny.git
``` 

### (2) CD to `CaDrA.shiny` folder where `Dockerfile` file is stored and build the Docker image. 

```bash
docker build -t cadra-shiny:1.0.0 .
```
**-t**: add a tag to an image such as the version of the application, e.g. *cadra-shiny:1.0.0* or *cadra-shiny:latest*. <br>

__NOTE:__ _The image takes approximately < 10 mins to build_

### (3) After the build is completed, you can check if the image is built successfully

```bash
docker images

REPOSITORY        TAG        IMAGE ID        CREATED        SIZE
cadra.shiny       1.0.0      2c22887402d3    2 hours ago    2.56GB
```

### (4) To run the container with the built image

```bash    
docker run -v /path/to/CaDrA.shiny:/CaDrA.shiny \
           -v /path/to/CaDrA.shiny/inst/shinyapp/shiny-server.sh:/usr/bin/shiny-server.sh \
           -p 8080:8050 --name cadra-shiny \
           -d cadra-shiny:1.0.0 
```

**NOTE:**

- Change __/path/to/CaDrA.shiny__ to your local `CaDrA.shiny` directory. This directory must contain all of the code base needed to build the `CaDrA.shiny` dashboard. <br>
- Change __/path/to/CaDrA.shiny/inst/shinyapp/shiny-server.sh__ to your local `CaDrA.shiny/inst/shinyapp/shiny-server.sh` directory. This directory contains a bash file used to launch `CaDrA.shiny` dashboard. <br>

**-v**: mount code base and data files from host directory to container directory **[host_div]:[container_dir]**. <br>
**-p**: map the host port to the container port **[host_port]:[container_port]** <br>
**`--`name**: give an identity to the container <br>
**-d**: run the container in detached mode <br>

For more information about the Docker syntax, see [Docker run reference](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/)

### (5) To check if the container is built sucessfully

```bash
docker container ps


CONTAINER ID   IMAGE               COMMAND                    CREATED        STATUS        PORTS                    NAMES
b37b6b19c4e8   cadra-shiny:1.0.0   "bash dashboard-kickoff"   5 hours ago    Up 5 hours    0.0.0.0:4567->3838/tcp   cadra-shiny

```

**NOTE:** The `cadra-shiny` container is published on port **4567** on the host machine, and **3838** is the port of where the `cadra-shiny` is published inside the container. All requests that are made to the host will be redirected to the Docker container.

### (6) Access `CaDrA` Shiny dashboard on the host network

You can visit the local host using your preferred web browser, type in http://localhost:4567, and check if the dashboard is indeed hosted there.
