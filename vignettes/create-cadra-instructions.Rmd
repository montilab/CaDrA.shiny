## 2. CaDrA Results

There are several results returned from running **CaDrA** search:

- Filtered feature set based on given filtered parameters
- Provided observed input scores
- Best meta-feature set was identified from the heuristic search 
- Meta-plot shows complementary features with their overlapping union and its enrichment score
- Overlapping heatmap shows best-features returned from repeating the search with top N features
